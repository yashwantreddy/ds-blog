<h1 id="my-data-science-journey">My Data Science Journey</h1>

<p>I began my Data Science journey back in 2018. I studied math and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python</code> through YouTube and a bunch of other free online resources. Using this newly acquired knowledge, I tried to get into a Data Science bootcamp called <a href="https://www.galvanize.com">Galvanize</a>. I failed the exam on my first try. I’m glad I did because that taught me my first lesson in Data Science-</p>

  <p><strong>Practice what you learn, implement it on your own</strong></p>

<p>Earlier, I was staring at YouTube video and blogposts, trying to memorize different concepts associated with math and Data Science. Neither had I implemented concepts or practiced what I was learning.</p>

<p>On my second attempt at the Galvanize admission test, I was able to use the different methods that I learnt by practicing over the last couple of weeks.</p>

<p>After my successful 3-month bootcamp at Galvanize, I discovered my yearning towards <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> or <strong>NLP</strong> in short. NLP is basically text processing, i.e., teaching AI models how to interpret text.</p>

<p>NLP was under-utilized back in 2018 (and is still kinda in a few domains like the energy generation industry), so an added benefit was that I could learn and continue to grow in this field.</p>

<p>My first job was at a startup called <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/proximate-io">Proximate.io</a>, where I was working on NLP based Data Science pipelines which dealt with classifying emails into hot/warm/damp/cold sales leads.</p>

<p>I worked here (remotely) for around 4 months, and had to leave when we weren’t able to secure enough funding to continue.</p>

<p>My next job needed me to relocate to Columbus, OH and it was with <a href="https://ventechsolutions.com">Ventech Solutions</a> - a company which was looking to transform the smaller clinics in the healthcare domain by digitizing their data and introducing Statistical or AI solutions.</p>

<p>To give you a tl;dr of my time at Ventech,</p>
